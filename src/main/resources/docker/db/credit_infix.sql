Up to 60% of the money the Taliban make from opium trafficking and poppy farming (6.6 billion in 2021) comes from these activities. Finally, the nation is still receiving humanitarian relief from abroad. In early January 2022, the UN made an unprecedented emergency request for USD 5 billion. In December 2021, the World Bank announced the transfer of USD 280 million in humanitarian relief through the country\'s ARTF special fund. However, because debt rather than grants is being used to finance the deficit, the state debt, which has historically been primarily external and relatively low, is predicted to rise. The country received USD 10 million in debt service relief from the IMF in 2021, although financing this could be challenging. It is possible that a sovereign debt default will occur. The government will be able to access significant domestic savings through the first-ever Sukuk (sharia-compliant bond) issue, which is planned for early 2022. This will eventually spark the growth of a domestic debt market. Large inflows of grant money were used to partially bridge the current account deficit. The U.S.\'s suspension and freezing of the country\'s foreign exchange reserves, which are estimated to total over $9 billion (15 months\' worth of imports), has made it difficult for it to pay for its imports and compelled it to cut back on them. Since 10 December 2021, the United States has once again authorized expatriate remittances, which are a welcome source of cash. The United States, China, Russia and Pakistan, as part of the Troika Plus, are holding talks with Taliban leaders, aware that a deterioration would have repercussions on neighbouring countries and beyond (terrorism, drug trafficking, population exodus).'),(2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,' ALL ','Albanian Lek','Albania','Tirana intends to raise actual tax receipts in accordance with the pre-pandemic consolidation of state finances in order to decrease the deficit. In particular, the initiatives would focus on reducing exemptions and combating tax evasion. On the expenditure front, persistently high inflation would drive the need for additional assistance for low-income households and raise the price of investments. The government has relied on concessional financing for the 2022 budget due to civil unrest and an unfavorable debt structure. Albania\'s debt, which is mostly due soon, could be subject to foreign exchange risk because the local banking sector is still heavily based on the euro (50%). The Albanian current account deficit will continue to be among the biggest in Eastern Europe because of a limited export market. The key to the problems is the balance of goods, which will remain largely negative in 2023 due to a structural reliance on foreign trade for a variety of goods (machines, vehicles, pharmaceutical drugs, fuels, plastics, etc.), which is made worse by inflation and the need for investments. The balance of goods was negative at about 22% of GDP in 2022. The increase in tourism is anticipated to support the services surplus (9% in 2022), but the decline in remittances from expatriates as a result of the slowdown in the economies of Germany and Italy will not reduce the current account deficits, which should continue to be financed by FDI and concessional financing for infrastructure.'),(3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,' DZD ','Algerian Dinar','Algeria','Algeria\'s economic expansion in 2022 benefited from the sharp rise in hydrocarbon prices and the increase in demand in Europe as a result of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine. The economic activity of the nation, which is heavily dependent on the energy industry, is anticipated to deteriorate in 2023 as a result of the falling income from oil exports. The latter will be related to the industry\'s constrained production capacity as well as the modest drop in oil prices, which will see a barrel of Brent fall from an average price of USD 100 in 2022 to an average price of USD 95 in 2023. Oil output is anticipated to plateau at about 1 million barrels per day in 2023 as a result of several years of underinvestment, decreasing the net contribution of exports. The economy should nevertheless grow steadily, supported by greater gas exports to Europe, which is looking for alternate energy sources to Russian gas. Production is anticipated to rise by 6.6% during the course of the year as a result of public and international investment in the gas sector. The non-hydrocarbon industry, particularly the construction and agricultural sectors, will also benefit from public and private investment. Last but not least, the government\'s social support programs for households, which account for 42% of GDP, are predicted to promote economic activity by growing by 2.7%. The latter, however, will continue to struggle in 2023 due to strong inflationary pressures.

Since most consumer and equipment goods are produced abroad, inflation pressures, which are primarily imported, will continue to be a major issue in 2023. As prices continue to rise but not as quickly as they did in 2022, the inflationary dynamic will likely slow down.

A comeback in foreign visitor numbers would be delayed in addition to China\'s zero-COvid policy by the context of rising inflation and supply restrictions, particularly if fuel and food shortages materialize. 10% of GDP in 2019 was attributed to tourism, which fell to 2.9% in 2021. Meanwhile, strong demand for copper and power should propel exports despite a global slowdown in trade. Additionally, the China-Laos railway, which starts operations in late 2021, will benefit copper, which is primarily shipped to China. The completion of various projects in 2022, such as Nam Theun 1 Hydropower, will help with electricity exports, which are primarily destined for Thailand. The industry will expand as a result of increased investments, particularly in the Monsoon Wind project, the largest wind energy project in Southeast Asia, with a capacity of 600 megawatts anticipated by 2025. As a result, building would increase (34% of GDP in 2021). The agriculture industry, which accounts for 15% of the GDP and 61% of employment in 2019, would also be impacted by high prices since rises in the cost of gasoline, animal feed, and fertilizer would have an impact on production.

Prior to the conflict, they made up 9.4% of all exports and 11.5% of all imports of products into Latvia, together with Belarus, a smaller trading partner. The equipment industry, which accounts for 16% of Latvia\'s exports and was previously heavily dependent on Russian steel and iron, is being particularly negatively impacted by the current EU sanctions and is now forced to rely on other more expensive suppliers. The pharmaceutical industry, whose revenue fell by 30%, agriculture, and the wood industry are all affected by issues with the supply of input products from Russia that have been either stopped by the EU or by counter-sanctions. Imports of fertilizer and lumber have also decreased by half over the summer of 2022. High energy prices and supply unpredictability have a significant influence on the entire economy, despite Latvia\'s efforts to lessen its reliance on Russian imports (which, as of mid-2022, accounted for 31% of Latvian energy consumption). Russian gas imports will be prohibited starting in January 2023. Due to the high level of input costs as well as the decline in export markets, all businesses are suffering. A significant downturn in Western Europe likely result in fewer exports to the EU, but some of this will be offset by increased shipments of wood due to EU bans on Belarusian wood imports. While the inflation rate should decline in 2023 on the back of lower price pressure than in 2022, progression of the purchasing power will remain low, even if wages are partially adapted to the higher price level at the beginning of 2023.

However, due to lack of confidence and persistently high inflation in line with sharp local currency depreciation, growth in private consumption, Lebanon\'s traditionally largest contributor to GDP (around 100% of GDP), will remain muted. At August 2023, its official rate had lost about 90% since the economy started to collapse in October 2019, while the parallel rate and central bank-administered Sayrafa rate used for customs were about six times higher than the official rate. The Lebanese pound may be officially devalued more as inflation expectations weaken. Public consumption, which makes up about 15% of GDP, and investment, which makes up 10% of GDP, would be affected by the limited budgetary flexibility. Private investment will be badly impacted by weak infrastructure (limited electricity supply from Electricité du Liban) and a bad business climate characterized by a high perception of corruption and onerous bureaucracy. Regional instability, ongoing operational, and logistical issues all hurt exports. Syria continues to have a restricted capacity for food and beverage production, which limits exports. On the other hand, the protracted economic crisis puts pressure on domestic demand, which depends significantly on imports, preventing a further expansion of the detrimental impact of foreign trade on GDP. Due to security concerns that can influence international tourists\' decisions to travel to the country, growth in tourism revenues is predicted to be about 10% in 2024 rather than the 25% rise predicted for 2023. Due to a lack of an efficient monetary strategy and growing (imported) food prices, inflation will continue to be extraordinarily high. Current political unpredictability and declining confidence will accelerate dollarization and hence drive inflation. Although the impact of the tripling of customs taxes, fees, and duties on all imported goods in March 2023—customs taxes will be calculated at 45,000 Lebanese pounds to the dollar, up from 15,000 pounds to the dollar previously—will gradually diminish, shortages of basic goods will not be affected by this.

Sanctions and trade restrictions are now having an impact on these trade flows. The same holds true for Belarus, which was the eleventh export destination (3.0%) and Lithuania\'s ninth-largest trading partner in terms of products imported in 2021 (3.5% of all items imported). Oil and gas made up the majority of Russia\'s imports. In fact, in 2021, 83% of the Baltic nation\'s oil imports and 40% of its natural gas imports came from Russia. Nevertheless, in mid-May 2022, Lithuania became the first nation in the EU to halt all energy imports from Russia. This is mostly due to Lithuania\'s ability to diversify its gas sources thanks to the LNG terminal in Klaipeda, which is located on the country\'s coast, and the Klaipeda pipeline into the interior. But achieving energy independence from Russia had a hefty cost. The headline inflation rate in early fall 2022 was 24% year over year, the highest of all the Eurozone countries, due to skyrocketing energy and food prices. This was the highest inflation rate for Lithuania since 1996. Consumer prices are anticipated to rise even more in 2023, albeit more slowly than in 2022. As a result, the inflation rate should significantly decline while continuing to be very high. Consumer purchasing power has been severely reduced as a result of the consumer price explosion, with private consumption accounting for 62% of nominal GDP in 2022 and private investments for 22% of GDP. Both the decline in savings and the increase in interest rates will have a negative impact in 2023. Given the extremely favorable labor market position, private consumption may continue to be slightly more robust than investments in this context. By the end of 2022, the unemployment rate will have fallen to about 8.3%, which is below the pre-pandemic level. This might increase consumer assurance.

The tourism industry, which in a typical year directly contributes 25% of GDP or 60% when adding allied industries like food providers, is extremely important to the economy. In a broad sense, the service sector is responsible for 78% of GDP. Due to the Maldives\' popularity as a travel destination for Chinese citizens before the pandemic and its approval by the Chinese government at the end of 2022, growth will continue to be largely driven by the tourism industry, which will benefit from the uptick in Chinese tourism. This will counterbalance the weaker purchasing power and decreased robustness of tourism from the European Union and the United States, as well as the rising competition from some increasingly alluring locations, such as Thailand. This will be combined with arrivals from India and Russia. Tourism-related industries like transportation and retail will benefit from this.

The state has subsidized the losses of the public utility Enemalta for this policy, which was to freeze retail energy rates at 2014 levels. As a result, Malta has the lowest inflation rate in the eurozone. In addition, with an unemployment rate under 3%, the labor market, which was already constrained before the pandemic, is considerably tighter, which is pushing wages up further.

Despite the exorbitant cost of imported energy, net exports will contribute positively. The relatively modest NextGenerationEU (NGEU) fund allocation (1.7% of GDP) and the nation\'s efforts to create a business-friendly climate, notably for the tech sector, will help to attract investment.

In 2024, growth is predicted to stabilize and remain comfortable.

Since income fundamentals remained favorable (including a robust employment market, remittances from expatriates in the US, and a rising wage bill), the outcome was particularly driven by strong services, including retail.

In 2023, things will stay the same. Although the consumer nations of Europe are exploring for alternatives, such as by building LNG facilities, these initiatives still need some time until the European energy market adjusts to the new circumstances.

There is an immediate possibility that Slovakia\'s energy supplies to Russia could be stopped given that Slovakia is actively backing Ukraine, with which it shares a 97km-long border. The nation still had enough reserves to survive through the 2022–2023 winter without importing Russian gas thanks to its reasonably full gas storage (as of mid–January 2023, storage capacity was still 73% full). The proposed gas interconnector between Poland and Slovakia, which can supply Slovakia with LNG from the ports on the Baltic Sea, will be one of the alternative sources until 2023. Even Norwegian gas might be delivered to Slovakia via the Baltic Pipe that connects the Polish and Danish gas networks. However, it is unlikely that these sources could offset the Russian deliveries.

Additionally, the primary drivers (fuel, food, and power) will continue to be high through most of 2023, despite the fact that inflation, which peaked at 7.8%, is steadily declining. Given the lack of investor confidence, a weaker rand is likely to increase the cost of imported products, especially food. The high unemployment rate (over 30%) and inflation will have an adverse effect on household disposable income and, consequently, on consumption (which accounts for 66% of GDP).

Spain, however, is less dependent on Russian gas than other European nations and gets the majority of its supplies from the US and Algeria. Additionally, it is less vulnerable to the possibility of a supply disruption due to its geographical isolation and low level of gas connection with the rest of the continent.

In addition, because of persistently high commodity prices and high global energy and food prices, private consumption will inadvertently suffer. In 2023, inflation will also continue to be high.

Energy price pressures were lower than in many other Western European nations in recent years because of the country\'s considerable reliance on nuclear and renewable energy sources (particularly hydropower). The Swiss Franc\'s strength helped keep imported inflation at a low level. As a result, despite pressures from the real estate market to the upside, the Swiss inflation rate slipped below the Swiss National Bank\'s (SNB) objective of 2% in June 2023 and is projected to stay there.

Nevertheless, despite the predicted slowdown in growth, it should still be strong because of present and upcoming infrastructure projects\' public and private investment. For instance, it is anticipated that the standard gauge railroad project will proceed. Beginning in late 2019, construction on the railway line will connect the nation with Rwanda and Uganda, followed by Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport plans to invest USD 1.7 billion on projects to develop transportation infrastructure, including this one. The purchase of four new Boeing aircraft by Air Tanzania is also budgeted for expenditure. According to the deal reached with Shell (UK) and Equinor (Norway), the USD 30 billion offshore natural gas production and liquefaction project is anticipated to get underway in 2023. However, as the final investment decision is not anticipated until 2025, the impact on GDP will be minimal in the short term. In contrast, as a result of the conflict in Ukraine, the terms of trade are deteriorating and the cost of imports is rising. While capital goods needed for infrastructure projects will continue to boost imports, the rise in fuel and food costs, along with disruptions to the fertiliser and pesticide markets, will reduce trade\'s ability to contribute to GDP. Furthermore, the decline in visitor numbers from Ukraine and Russia (11% of arrivals in 2021) is anticipated to have an adverse impact on tourism revenues, which were already battling to return to their pre-crisis level. The cost of imported items is also growing, as are commodity costs, driving inflation to its highest level since 2017, which will reduce the contribution of private spending. Nevertheless, the central bank\'s 5% objective for inflation is not expected to be reached, and the announced elimination of the mobile money levy will increase consumer spending power.\n'),(113,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,' THB ','Thai Baht','Thailand','In 2023, Thailand\'s economic development is anticipated to pick up speed, enabling real GDP to surpass its pre-pandemic (2019) level for the first time. Due to the removal of internal and international mobility constraints, the tourism-related industries will keep growing. While this proportion was only 0.6% in 2021, international visitor arrivals during the January–November period in 2022 were 25% more than those reported during the same time in 2019. The reopening of Chinese borders should also help the tourism industry in 2023 because, before the pandemic, China accounted for the largest share of all foreign visitors (27.6% of the total in 2019). Recovery in the tourism industry will aid in the expansion of the labor market, which will promote private spending (55% of GDP in 2021). The unemployment rate decreased from a 16-year high of 2.3% in the third quarter of 2021 to 1.2% in the same period of 2022, even though it remained higher than in 2019, when it averaged 1%. From a 14-year peak in 2022, inflation is predicted to sharply drop, relieving the burden on private consumption. In that sense, the Bank of Thailand implemented three increases of 25 basis points in 2022, which was a reasonably gradual rate of monetary tightening. In the first half of 2023, the Thai central bank is anticipated to keep raising interest rates. Any move toward monetary tightening could have an adverse effect on household expenditure, which is already constrained by a high level of debt (86.8% as of the third quarter of 2022). Private investment should be strong despite rising interest rates during an economic recovery.  However, other businesses that are focused on exports, like electronics, may suffer from global headwinds.

President Kas Saed took over the judiciary at the end of July 2021 and began enforcing his institutional agenda after being elected in October 2019. He suspended Parliament, removed the Prime Minister, and gradually changed the institutional landscape. A system centered on the President was passed by a constitutional vote in July 2022, and local powers with consistently hazy mandates were created. Two rounds of early legislative elections were held between December 2022 and January 2023, although only a relatively small number of voters participated due to a boycott by the parties and a request to abstain from the influential UGTT union, which is heavily represented in public companies. While President Saed still enjoys some support from the working classes, the implementation of reforms will be hampered by a weaker economy, union opposition, and mistrust of liberal elites.'),(115,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,' TRY ','Turkish Lira','Turkiye','After the elections in May 2023, Turkey\'s credit-driven economic boom will slow down because this model pushed for lower interest rates despite increasing inflation (85% y-o-y in October 2022). By the end of 2023, the central bank is anticipated to increase its policy rate from 8.5% in May 2023 to between 25 and 30%. Despite this, rate increases are still expected to be slow and unclear given the high level of anticipated inflation at the end of 2023 (between 60 and 65 percent) and the precarious state of the economy. Early in July 2023, the average interest rate for consumer loans was 48 percent, for commercial loans it was 25 percent, and for one-month deposits it was 28 percent. All of these rates were significantly higher than the bank\'s policy rate. Inflationary pressures on the economy will be exacerbated by the government\'s decision to raise taxes on a wide range of goods and services, the lira\'s sharp 30% depreciation between January and July 2023, an increase of 86% for the lowest-grade public employees after the elections, and a total increase of 107% in the minimum wage in 2023. As a result, within our projected horizon, a return to single-digit inflation will not be possible. Private demand will be hampered by persistently high inflation and tightening financial constraints. In the time following the March 2024 municipal elections, private consumption, which has been high for a while as a result of demand being pushed ahead by rising inflation, will have a reduced impact on growth. On the other hand, government spending will continue to have a beneficial impact due to the necessity for reconstruction following the earthquakes in February 2023 (estimated at roughly USD 26 billion) and other potential spending before the local elections. Banks will be reluctant to lend to the private sector due to tougher economic conditions for their customers, the requirement to match credit with Treasury purchases, and the maintenance of interest rate ceilings on commercial loans, all of which were imposed by the central bank as part of its macro-prudential measures. This will have an impact on investment growth and pose a serious risk to businesses since it makes it more difficult to manage cash flow, especially for those who are heavily indebted. If macroprudential restrictions on loans are relaxed, businesses may have more access to credit, but at a higher cost.'),(116,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,' UGX ','Ugandan Shilling','Uganda','Uganda\'s economy slowed down in 2022 as a result of significant inflationary pressure. This prompted the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate from 6.5% to 9% between May and August 2022. By putting pressure on credit, this increase has an impact on domestic private investment. The development of the oil fields Tilenga and Kingfisher, which are both close to Lake Albert, by the Chinese China NATIONAL offshore Oil Corporation and the French TotalEnergies will continue in 2023 in preparation for the start of production in 2025. The Mines and Minerals Act revision is anticipated to have positive effects on the economy as well. The elimination of the 5% tax imposed on exports of refined gold, which makes up the majority of the metal shipped, in July 2021 will theoretically be replaced by a levy of $100 per kilogram, which should increase the metal\'s hitherto nonexistent exports. Agriculture, which accounts for 23% of the GDP, will also be a key driver of growth because of the high demand and high prices for commodities like maize and coffee on the international and regional markets. With 6.65 million bags produced in the 2022–2023 season, Uganda is No. 2 in Africa and among the top ten coffee producers in the world. To lessen the impact of climate change on agricultural production, government authorities want to begin increasing forest cover from 2.6% to 15%. Income from agriculture will mitigate the effects of inflation on household consumption. Furthermore, tourism (which accounts for 10% of exports), particularly from the hotel sector, will contribute to increasing activity, barring unfavorable developments in the health situation (such as the Covid-19 and Ebola). Growth in manufacturing output should also occur (16% of GDP with agri-food, clothing, and construction materials), as well as the development of information and communication technologies (10% of exports), such as fintech, with the rise in mobile money transactions following Covid.\n'),(117,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,' UAH ','Ukrainian Hryvnia','Ukraine','Increases in household spending and investments helped to assist the economic recovery in 2021, but the pre-pandemic level was not attained since a favorable base effect contributed to much of the increase. Additionally, Ukraine profited from a significant increase in the price of its main exports, particularly iron and wheat. Strong harvests should continue to support higher export quantities over the first several months of 2022. Due to increased base effects and the price stabilization of the most inflating components, inflation will slow down, but household consumption, which accounts for 74% of GDP, will continue to be the main engine of growth. The National Bank of Ukraine raised interest rates many times (to 8.5% as of November 2021) in response to the acceleration of inflation brought on by rising food and energy costs, which caused it to reach 11% in September 2021.\n \nThe rehabilitation process is still under risk from the COVID-19 pandemic. In autumn 2021, there have been more cases and hospitalizations despite the delayed immunization program. Ukraine has some of the lowest vaccination rates in all of Europe, with only 17.2% of the populace having received all recommended vaccinations as of the end of October 2021. Companies are also aware that it can slow down the recovery process. The risk of a new shutdown was cited as the top concern by 61% of questioned enterprises in the American Chamber of Commerce and Citi Ukraine poll, which was released in September 2021. On the other hand, 93% of the polled businesses argued that the government should take urgent action to enhance the business environment and draw in foreign investment by fighting corruption and enacting substantive judicial changes.

The OPEC+ extension of oil output limits to the end of 2024 will still be a hindrance, though. The activity in the non-oil sector will continue to be strong. The government will be forced to expedite economic reforms (such as new commercial law allowing foreigners to fully own companies, new labor law shifting weekends from Friday and Saturday to Saturday and Sunday in 2022) in response to increasing competition from neighboring Saudi Arabia, which will have a favorable effect on investments (about 20% of GDP). A decline in inflation as well as an influx of foreign labor drawn by the economic diversification in Abu Dhabi and Dubai (where Emiratis make up around 10% of the overall population) will support private consumption, which accounts for close to 40% of GDP. Additionally, the UAE, which has maintained its neutrality in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, has welcomed an increasing number of wealthy Russian immigrants and tourists, as well as high-tech workers who were fleeing Western sanctions. They will further increase consumption and the local real estate market. Additionally, the UAE will continue to play an increasingly important role as a trading hub for Russian gold since the war\'s outbreak in 2022. According to Russian customs, the UAE bought almost 76 tons of Russian gold valued close to USD 3 billion between February 2022 and March 2023, up from 1.3 tonnes in 2021. Similar to how restrictions from Switzerland have caused oil trading to shift to the UAE, increasing storage capabilities in Fujairah. These positions are anticipated to be strengthened by the UAE\'s political neutrality and strategic proximity to markets in Asia and Africa. Additionally, the government\'s plan to boost foreign tourism by increasing the number of visitors will be helpful. The two greatest sources of arrivals over the forecast period will be the Asia-Pacific and Middle-East areas (estimated at between 5.1 million and 5.09 arrivals in 2023, respectively, according to the BMI). Tourism revenue is projected to increase by 7% year over year to USD 43.7 billion (9% of GDP) in 2024, adding to the weight of private spending. However, government spending (which accounts for about 12% of GDP) will be mostly focused on business incentives and reforms rather than stimulus plans that will increase consumer spending.

The Statement featured a number of household energy and cost-of-living support measures (+GBP 25 billion, 1.1% of GDP) as well as some support measures for public spending (+GBP 7.8 billion, 0.4% of GDP), including increased funding for the NHS, social care, and education.

Increased taxes, primarily on corporations, such as windfall taxes on energy producers and extraction businesses as well as other business taxes (+ GBP 7.1 billion, 0.3% of GDP), will only partially offset these costs. As a result, national debt will keep growing. Political unrest, inflation, and the BoE\'s policies all contribute to financing costs staying high. Since inflation-indexed bonds, which make up around 25% of the debt, were over 60% of the debt interest payments in November 2022, rising inflation has further impacted the budget. The BoE declared its intention to begin selling some of its holdings of government bonds (Gilts) in August 2022.

Due to the continued influence of these variables, growth will decline further in 2023. Although it is anticipated that inflation will continue its lowering trend from the second half of last year, it is still likely to be higher than the Federal Reserve\'s target rate of 2%. The Fed will continue a cycle of monetary tightening unseen in more than 40 years in the first quarter of 2022 after lifting its policy rate by 425 basis points in that year. The target rate band set by the Fed may be increased by an additional 75 basis points to 5.00% - 5.25%. Through 2023, rates are anticipated to stay at current stifling levels. Household consumption, which accounts for 68% of GDP, will therefore decline. Spending should continue to be distributed more towards services and away from products, which had profited from the outbreak. Therefore, the manufacturing sector might suffer. The easing of inflation, rising credit card debt, and a lack of saving, however, might help maintain household expenditures and (slimly) prevent a recession. Despite this, the unemployment rate is anticipated to increase from its low 3.7% at the end of 2022, which might cause people to be more cautious. Additionally, the climate of high interest rates will restrict investment. At the end of 2022, there will still be a sustainably comfortable cash position, but business capital spending plans will be scaled back. Residential investment ought to decline more. In 2023, there will be less construction activity as a result of the real estate market\'s decline.

Before the COVID-19 shock, this sector, which is important to the economy, contributed 16.4% to GDP and 16.3% to employment in 2019. The slowdown in activity in Argentina and Brazil, which are neighbors, may, however, have some impact on the recovery in tourism. The new UPM mill should begin to pay off in terms of international sales, which will increase exports of goods related to pulp. Additionally, growth of traditional exports (which account for 16% of GDP and include beef, soybean, dairy, rice, and wood products) will slow down from its strong performances in 2021 and 2022 due to weakening growth momentum in its main trading partners (China, Brazil, and the European Union), as well as an assumption of some easing in the price of agricultural commodities in 2023. Furthermore, the La Nia poses a downside risk to the crop in 2022–2023 for the third straight year. Finally, due to rising global borrowing rates and the cancellation of major projects like the UPM pulp factory and the Ferro Central Railway (both anticipated for Q1 2023), the increase of gross fixed investment might slow down.

Some of Vietnam\'s major trading partners, like the United States (which will account for 28.7% of its total exports of goods in 2021) and the European Union (which will account for 11.9%), are anticipated to see their demand decline. The European Union is one of the regions that has been facing significant recession concerns ever since the conflict in Ukraine. Vietnam\'s export prospects are deteriorating as a result of the slowing of China\'s economy, which is partly attributable to the country\'s tough Covid-19 policy. China is Vietnam\'s second-largest export market for goods (16.7% of the total in 2021). Making up 23.4% of the GDP in 2021, the manufacturing sector is anticipated to suffer from this. Despite this, the nation should continue to gain from the diversification of the global supply chain, which was initially sparked by the US-China trade war and strengthened by supply interruptions brought on by the pandemic. By luring in foreign capital, this has especially helped the growth of the textile, apparel, and electronics industries. Therefore, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows increased significantly after increasing by about 90% year over year in the first eight months of 2022. Since the government started treating Covid-19 as an endemic disease, domestic demand has undoubtedly increased, contributing to Vietnam\'s economic growth. After the government closed its borders to foreign travelers in March 2022, tourism—which contributed nearly 10% of GDP in 2019—will further drive local consumption. Although China, which accounted for about 32% of inbound visits in 2019, was the primary source of international tourists, the industry will continue be burdened by lingering travel restrictions in that country.

In 2023, a moderate continuation of the trend is anticipated, with household spending and mining exports continuing to be the primary drivers. An expansionary fiscal policy in the run-up to the elections and a brief dip in inflation should allow consumption to pick up in the first half of the year. However, the impact on growth should be lessened by the increase in imports associated with the weakened manufacturing base. Due to a 10% increase in the amount of arable land being cultivated, which was already abundant the previous season, the autumn 2022 harvest saw a significant increase in the production of wheat. The two-thirds of the people that depend on agriculture ought to gain from this. Stocks of maize, a major crop, were equivalent to 12 months\' worth of usage in December 2022.
